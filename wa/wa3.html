    <p style="color: rgb(201, 201, 201);">The lightsaber, also referred to as a <em>laser sword</em> by those who were unfamiliar with it, was a weapon usually used by the Jedi, Sith, and other Force-sensitives. Lightsabers consisted of a plasma blade, powered by a kyber crystal, that was emitted from a usually metal hilt and could be shut off at will. It was a weapon that required skill and training, and was greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with the Force. Though also used by the Sith, the lightsaber was synonymous with the Jedi, with some in the galaxy believing only Jedi could use lightsabers.

        Lightsabers were generally used for both offense and defense. A lightsaber could cut through virtually anything, from flesh to blast doors. The only ways to block the incoming attack of a lightsaber was with a weapon made with material that conducted energy, such as an electrostaff, a Z6 riot control baton, some rare metals like beskar, or another lightsaber. When used defensively, a Force-sensitive could deflect blaster bolts with a lightsaber, and with skill, could even reflect the shots back toward the shooter or some other target. Experienced Jedi could even employ their lightsabers to absorb Force lightning. Most practitioners used one single-bladed lightsaber, though some used double-bladed lightsabers or even multiple lightsabers at once. A popular example to using multiple lightsabers is Grievous.

    <p style="color: rgb(201, 201, 201);">Sounding like no other weapon in the galaxy,[17] lightsabers were used thousands of years before the age of the Galactic Republic, seeing use in the Great Scourge of Malachor.[18] They were also used in the Battles of Rashfond and the Peacekeeping of Parliock,[1] The proto-saber was an ancient type of prototype lightsaber.[19]

        Lightsabers took on a more prominent role in galactic affairs as the Clone Wars came to pass. Jedi, previously peacekeepers, became Jedi Generals of the Grand Army of the Republic, and thus began using their lightsabers more often than they had in their role of peacekeeping.[20]
        For the majority of the Empire's reign, the only lightsabers that were prominently used were those of Darth Vader and the Inquisitors who served him. In its waning years, it saw a rise in lightsaber use by Jedi survivors and those they trained, like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Kanan Jarrus, and Ezra Bridger.[2] Domina Tagge of the Tagge Corporation tried to recreate the lightsaber through the Tagge protoblade.[21]
        After the Empire was defeated, Luke began training a new generation of Jedi. They, however, were killed in the destruction of his Jedi temple, once again leading to a time where the only prominent lightsaber user was a darksider, Kylo Ren.[15]
        That all changed when a scavenger, Rey, discovered the Skywalker lightsaber[15] and ultimately came to train under Luke Skywalker and his twin sister Leia Organa to combat Kylo Ren and the First Order during a war against the Imperial Remains.[22]
        After the war, Rey ritually buried her masters' lightsabers at the Lars Homestead on Luke's home planet, Tatooine, to end the Skywalker family's suffering. She ignited her newly crafted lightsaber to show her complete journey as a Jedi, and, to honor the Skywalkers' legacy, she took the Skywalker name as her surname after receiving the blessing from the Force ghosts of her teachers when she was asked by a local.[23]</p>

    <p style="color: rgb(201, 201, 201);">General Grevious used lightsabers from the Jedi he defeated, meaning his lightsabers were usually green or blue, despite him being a villain. Grevious also had multiple arms as well as flexible robotic joints that made him a very unique lightsaber user.</p>
