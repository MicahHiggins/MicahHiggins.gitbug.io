        <p> My extension for this assignment was adding a loading screen each time the "Generate a new quote!" button was pressed. 
          In CSS, I added a link to a loading GIF in the same spot that the quote text is in.
          In JS, I created two small functions that hide the loading animation and display it.
          In the GetQuote function, I use the display loading function before fetching the quote,
          then use the hide loading function just before showing the quote. I also put a 0.5 second
          delay on the displayQuote function, and the hide loading function so that the loading screen would appear for an additional 0.5 seconds since 
          the quote was being fetched too fast to properly see the loading screen.</p>
