        Log of Changes Made to Pages 1-4
    </h1>
    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The html starting tag had no language defined so I assigned the english attribute to it</li>
        <li>Line 24 was missing a list item/li end tag so I provided it with a list item end tag </li>
        <li>Line 36 was missing a table data/td end tag so I gave it this end tag</li>
        <li>There was no end tag for the tr element, so I put a tr end tag on line 42</li>
        <li>There was no end tag for the table element, so I put a table end tag on a new line, after line 42</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Line 27 was missing part of its end tag for the b element so added /b within the angle brackets </li>
        <li>Line 74 had no end tag for the 6th header/h6 element so I gave it an end tag</li>
        <li>Line 57 had an href with no link associated with it, so i provided a wikipedia page link for the anchor so that when the text is clicked on, it will go to the wikipedia page</li>
        <li>On line 53, a header isn't allowed to be a child element of a b/bold element so i removed the b element</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Line 1 was missing the doctype so I added the doctype html</li>
        <li>The page was missing the meta content within the head tag so i used the meta content from page 4 on page 3</li>
        <li>There was no title within the head tag so I gave it a title called Page 3 on line 7</li>
        <li>The html starting tag had no language defined so I assigned the english attribute to it</li>
        <li>The page was missing a link to its CSS stylesheet called cars.css so I added this link on line 8</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Line 1 was missing the doctype so I added the doctype html</li>
        <li>Line 38 was missing a td end tag so I gave it one</li>
        <li>Line 43 was missing the table data/td start and end tags so I surrounded the img tag with the td tags</li>
        <li>Line 48 was missing a td start tag so I gave it one</li>
        <li>Lines 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 47, 48, and 49 all had image tags without alt text so I provided each image with alt text that described the images</li>
    </ul>
